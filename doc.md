# Student Developers Club

*SDC* (with a playful, "scrambled" vibe to the abbreviation)

The Student Developers Club was founded to bring together curious minds who love exploring and tinkering with technology. We are a passionate team of software developers, and we’re always looking for new members who share our enthusiasm for building and learning.
